# The MovieDB Clone

A simple react app for browsing data from The MovieDB.
Users can view the popular and highest rated movies or search for specific movies using the search bar.
The project uses `react-router` to create multiple pages.
A live demo can be found [here.](https://ebrann-movie.herokuapp.com/)
